27-Oct-09,Application Development Theatre,14:00,14:30,Application Development,,Pekka Kosonen,Next Generation Hybrid Applications - Utilizing your Web Development Skills with Qt based Solutions,Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework. The integration of the open source WebKit browser engine and Qt application and UI framework blurs the line between application and content. The resulting mixed-mode services are efficient to build and deliver functionality that would be difficult or impossible to develop using only web APIs or only native development environments. Combining the simplicity of web technologies with the power of the Qt application framework allows designers and coders to concentrate on what they do best.

One development team's story of a four week Symbian WRT development project: the Wine.com mobile application. ,"Wine.com came to Exygy with a great idea (build a mobile Symbian app on top of the beta Wine API) and an insane timeline (get it done in 4 weeks). Exygy identified Symbian WRT as an easy to use framework that would allow for rapid development by leveraging well understood web technologies (mainly JavaScript). Exygy worked with Wine.com and Symbian to get a core application built rapidly and continues to work with Wine.com to build new features.&nbsp; In this talk, we'll look at the Wine.com app as a case study illustrating the pros and cons of Symbian WRT development highlighting lessons learned during this rapid development project."

But, unlike traditional client/server and web development, mobile software offers significant challenges to engage users in both functional and usability feedback. So, many firms choose to ignore or just do basic functional testing. It's not enough... no wonder that 50% of applications crash on intended handsets or that only 3% of applications are still in use after 3 months. Great software leads to stickiness; increased customer loyalty to your brand (also known as 'going viral'). In a world where developers have limited marketing budgets, they must rely on a great user experience so that people will tell their friends and post great reviews. This word of mouth leads to sustained growth and mobile app success!<br /><br />In this session, we'll review two software product feedback techniques as they apply to mobile development: Townhalls and Customer Loyalty 2.0.<br /><br />1) Challenges of user feedback in mobile app development due to fragmentation<br />2) Using 'Townhall' techniques in the alpha cycle to get product feedback to optimize the user experience BEFORE you port or release<br />3) Using 'Customer Loyalty' techniques in the beta cycle to assess feedback in real-world situations, as well as identifying if your apps will go viral<br />"

Presentation is divided in 2 parts:

1) Theoretical approach to technology providing needed background information.
2) Practical approach with instructor led widget coding to show how to utilize available tools for WRT widget development. Presentation will cover for example:

We achieved this by growing an open source community around the technology, fostering an open development process, and inviting participation both in the terms of feedback and code contributions. In the process we created an Eclipse-based open source collaboration tool that has made it possible for a small team to apply and review hundreds of patches a year, and to effectively manage an enormous user base and backlog of feature requests. The end result is one of the most successful Eclipse projects, a de facto standard for ALM integrations with the Eclipse IDE, an active ecosystem of vendor extensions, and an ongoing stream of contributions that's helping evolve the technology and APIs. This talk will start with a summary of what we did, and then overview lessons learned for project managers and tips for potential contributors."

As a result of this the timescales for device creation are shrinking time and time again, increasing the pressure on the developement teams to deliver accordingly. This can only be achieved through a modular SW/HW architecture, with pretested SW provided by Silicon/HW vendors, a high degree of HW abstraction that facilitates SW reuse and a very complete base SW platform with minimal gaps eliminating having to fill such gaps during the device creation cycle. New proposals such as SHAI (Symbian Hardware Abstraction Interface) and some other initiatives put forward by the SF will address those issues"

Orange has created and provided to the Symbian Foundation a test tool that enables application developers, operators and handset manufactures a simple way to automate the creation of tests, to execute and manage the results
The UserEmulator is an on-device application which simulates user activity by generating key press and pointer input events. The tool helps in writing, reusing and executing tests on the applications under development. It is useful for automating functional, regression and stress testing, and can be used with other tools for monitoring memory use, power consumption and CPU activity over a period of time.
The UserEmulator uses an XML test script to describe events or can run in random mode. Tester can create the scripts using a text editor or can use the UserEmulator to record them on a device. Test scripts can be edited if necessary. The scripts contains XML tags for launching applications (using the application UID or name), taking screenshots and adding markers to the log file. When the UserEmulator is running it automatically takes screenshots of panics and logs them."
