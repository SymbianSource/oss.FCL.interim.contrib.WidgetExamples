 rounding multimillion dollar rounds of funding, it's easy forget there's
  another way to build a business: by being cheap and smart. By relying o
 n open source, building in increments, and only buying what you need, it
 's possible to create a successful company on your own (or with a few co
 -founders). This talk will focus on just that: the frugal path to profit
 ability.

 rojects
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Richard Fontana (Red Hat, Inc.). FOSS can be se
 en as a new kind of legal system that facilitates sharing rights in code
 . Viewed in this way, FOSS can benefit from greater public knowledge of 
 code origins and licensing rules. My talk will focus on practical guidan
 ce for projects seeking to improve legal certainty in the code they writ
 e and use. I  will conclude with some longer-term institutional proposal

SUMMARY:What Web App Design Can Learn From the Harpsichord
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Elaine  Wherry (Meebo). Baroque harpsichordists
  excelled at taking simple melodies and creating elaborate, beautiful pi
 eces of music. But in their desire to push the boundaries of experimenta
 tion, these keyboard virtuosi eventually ornamented the music beyond the
  limits of good taste, making the composer’s original melody unrecogniza
 ble. Something similar happens in web design.
