 fundamentalist functional programming-that is, radically eliminating all
  side effects from programming languages, including strict evaluation-is
  what it takes to conquer the concurrency and parallelism dragon.

SUMMARY:The Art of Klingon Programming
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Paul Fenwick (Perl Training Australia). A good 
 programmer needs many qualities: intelligence, foresight, dedication, an
 d the ability to fight off a hundred angry targh armed only with your ba
 t'leth. On Qo'noS, software developers undertake an intensive course in 
 combat programming before they are cleared for active duty. Join Paul Fe

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Kirill Kolyshkin (OpenVZ). The talk outlines th
 e standard Linux kernel mechanisms for controlling resources (such as CP
 U, RAM, disk) and reveals their shortcomings. It explains what are conta
 iners and why resource management is important for those. A new Linux ke
 rnel features -- cgroups and memory controller -- are explained in detai
 ls, with some tricky implementation details and a look into what else ha
 s yet to be done.

SUMMARY:Open APIs of The New York Times
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Derek Gottfrid (The New York Times). We have em
 barked on a mission to share more of what we do on the development side 
 of The Times. So far, we’ve done that via conference presentations, open
 -source software, blog posts and (most recently and probably most import
 antly) our APIs. We see our site as more than just a source of news and 
 information: it’s a platform on which news and information become buildi
 ng blocks.

SUMMARY:Forking Encouraged: Folk Programming, Open Source, and Social So
 ftware Development
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Kirrily Robert (Metaweb), Yoz Grahame (Linden L
 ab), Jason Douglas (Metaweb). The term "Folk Computing" was coined 20+ y
 ears ago to describe how people learn to program by copying and experime
 ntation.  Learn how open source licenses, hosted development environment
 s, and other folk programming concepts lower barriers to entry and help 
 people get up to speed as coders.  We'll also be showing off some modern
  folk programming platforms, from Yahoo Pipes to the OLPC and beyond.
