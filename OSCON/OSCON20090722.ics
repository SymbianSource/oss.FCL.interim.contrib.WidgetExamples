SUMMARY:New Ways for Teaching Children Software Programming
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Howard Abrams (Joule Labs). Software programmin
 g has come a long way for students and younger children since the days o
 f Logo. Syntax has been replaced with connecting blocks and the triangle
  turtle has been replaced with custom artwork children create themselves
 . Now, multi-threading and event processing are easier to teach children
  than functions, and this session discusses these ideas as well as so th
 e edge of kid code.

SUMMARY:Server Management & Source Control: The key to scalability and t
 eamwork
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Lance Albertson (Oregon State University Open S
 ource Lab). Keeping track of configuration changes between hundreds of s
 ervers is a challenging task not to mention keeping a history of all the
  changes that were made. This session focusing on utilizing open source 
 technology to not only help you manage your servers but it also promote 
 teamwork and self documentation. I'll focus on how the OSU Open Source L
 ab uses cfengine and git to manage their servers.

SUMMARY:Antifeatures
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Benjamin Mako Hill (MIT Center for Future Civic

 or of free and open source software based on what I call "antifeatures:"
  functionality that technology developers charge users to not include. F
 rom DRM to crippled OSes to digital cameras, I will show off many of the
  most egregious antifeatures and describe how open source both makes the
 m impossible and helps users work around them.

SUMMARY:Embracing Forks: How Git Changes Open Source Contribution
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Tom Preston-Werner (GitHub). Git is a distribut
 ed version control system with easy branching that has forever changed t
 he way that open source projects accept contributions. By embracing a pa
 ttern of casual forking, the barrier to submit patches and track upstrea
 m changes is reduced, resulting in an explosion of contributors and patc
 hes. This talk will use case studies to illustrate how your project can 
 enjoy these benefits.

SUMMARY:Open Source Analytics: Visualization and Predictive Modeling of 
 Big Data with the R Programming Language
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Michael Driscoll (Dataspora). The age of Big Da
 ta demands open-source tools that move beyond storage towards analytics:
   tools to turn terabytes into insights. R is an open-source language fo
 r statistical computing and graphics, and an extensible, embeddable tool
  for the analysis of large data sets. In this session, I showcase R's po
 wer by building predictive models for Brazilian soybean harvests and bas
 eball slugger salaries.

SUMMARY:Preventing Data Loss Through Prudent Archiving
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Bruce Momjian (EnterpriseDB). No one likes the 
 sinking feeling of having lost data --- pictures, documents, source code
 , or video that is gone and can never be fully recreated.  Though pruden
 t archiving and risk analysis, it is possible to avoid data loss in all 
 but the most extreme circumstances.  Data longevity is also an important
  aspect of archiving, including the use of open data formats.

SUMMARY:Practical Object-Oriented Models in SQL
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Bill Karwin (Karwin Software Solutions). SQL is
  from Mars, Objects are from Venus. This talk is for software developers
  who know SQL but are stuck trying to implement common object-oriented s
 tructures in an SQL database.  Mimicking polymorphism, extensibility, an
 d hierarchical data in the relational database paradigm can be confusing
  and awkward, but they don't have to be.
